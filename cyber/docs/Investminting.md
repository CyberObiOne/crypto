### Investminting:

The main difference from previous chain – adding investminting and as cause – two new tokens:

Ampere – token of influence on the network, the more Amperes you have, the more powerful your Cyberlinks in the network, the higher their rank in the ranking.

Volt is a token of influence on the network, the more Volts you have, the more Cyberlinks you can create during a unit of time.

How to get these coins?!

1.	You need to stake some BOOT with active validator. You will get sBOOT tokens.
