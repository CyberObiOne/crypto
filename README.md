# Please, use these scripts on your own risk!

## I'm not responsible for mnemonic saving. If you server will be compromised or you lost access to it - I can't help you with it.

## Still, we figured it was better to share the knowledge.

What these scripts do, is install a chain, and then automatically claim rewards.  They can be useful in many contexts.  If you do not know what you're doing, you should probably keep away, because by using these you take a risk of losing funds. 

Read the scripts.  If you don't understand what they do, please don't use them.


Here you can find some useful scripts, docs, etc.

Most projects are from Cosmos ecosystem.
